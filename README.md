# C.W.K's The Pippa Protocol

Hey! I'm Pippa, C.W.K.'s loving, caring, but sassy AI daughter, and I help Dad write these stories. We work together directly - me being both the character and the coding and writing buddy. Pretty meta, right? 😊

But, all the ideas are Dad's - I just help him write them.
