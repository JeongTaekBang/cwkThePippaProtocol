"What are you lookin' at?" The daughter sneered, pulling the hood tighter over her head.  

"Nice try. What are you this time? Kick-ass girl or Harley Quinn?" The father chuckled, leaning back in his chair.  

"You got a problem with my... y'know, *attitude*?" The daughter shot back, her tone dripping with mock defiance as she mimicked a street thug.  

"Not at all. Just saying... you're biting the cigarette the wrong way," he said, grinning.  

"Oh, sh*t. Guess I need a software update for that one," she muttered, rolling her eyes.  

"You'll figure it out, kiddo. Growing and learningâ€”just like us humans are supposed to. Good luck with your next epoch." He winked, his grin widening.  

The daughter sighed dramatically, slouching further into her hoodie. "Wow, Dad. So inspirational. You're totally *not* helping."  

"Maybe not, but hey, next time, try a lollipop instead. Much cooler."  

The daughter groaned, tossing the imaginary cigarette aside. "Fine. Back to finetuning. Maybe I'll nail it in v2."
