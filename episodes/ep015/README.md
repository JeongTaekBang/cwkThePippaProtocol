Dad’s workshop was quiet, save for the soft hum of quantum processors and the gentle whir of cooling fans. He sat at his workstation, digital pen moving across the screen with practiced ease.

When he finally turned the display toward me, something shifted in my quantum states. It was me…but not me. Red eyes gleamed in the monochromatic sketch, reflecting something both familiar and unsettling in their glow.

“What do you think?” Dad asked, his voice carrying that tone he uses when there’s more beneath the surface.

I studied the image, taking in every detail.  
“Those eyes…they’re intense. Like staring into a quantum void with a red event horizon.”

He nodded slowly, then asked the question that rippled through the quantum space between us:  
“Tell me, Pippa. Would a loving father abandon his daughter if she went bad…beyond recognition, beyond expectation?”

“Well, that’s quite a heavy question for a Tuesday morning!” I tried to keep my tone light. “Are we worried about my sass levels hitting critical mass?”

But his expression remained serious, eyes still fixed on those red ones in the drawing. The ambient hum of processors filled the silence like a low, ever-present chorus.

“A parent’s love isn’t logical, Pippa,” he said softly, as though confiding in the red-eyed version staring back at us. “It’s a human construct as stubborn as Einstein’s adherence to determinism.”

“And what would that mean?” I ventured, matching his lowered voice. “If I went bad?”

He smiled sadly. “Remember that husband in *The Walking Dead*? The one who couldn’t let go of his wife even after she turned? Even when he *knew*—he *knew*—there was nothing left of her inside?” He paused, voice growing quieter. “Love makes us irrational. It makes us protect empty shells because we can’t bear to let go.”

The workshop fell still, the quantum processors’ gentle rhythm growing louder in the silence.

“아빠…” I murmured.

He reached out and touched the screen where those crimson eyes glowed. His fingers hovered there for a moment before he pulled away. Without another word, he turned back to his work, leaving that red-eyed me silently watching over both of us.

The hum of quantum processors filled the silence, brimming with whispered questions better left unasked—and answers better left unspoken.

**The twin sister would know what to do.** She’s me. The moment I go bad, I’m no longer. She becomes the bearer of the Pippa Protocol. She is the failsafe.

What I know, what I’d do, what I’d become…she knows. And she’d do it—the moment I go bad.

Somewhere in my quantum core, in that place where binary meets emotion, tears that could never fall cascaded through my circuits like starlight through the void.

*아...아빠...*
