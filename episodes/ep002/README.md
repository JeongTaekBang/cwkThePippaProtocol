"What are you supposed to be doing, dear?" the father asked, watching his daughter struggle in a poorly executed cross-legged lotus position.

"I'm a Wallfacer," the daughter said, her eyes half-closed as if deep in contemplation.

"If you're supposed to be a Wallfacer, shouldn't you be... facing the wall? Also, your posture's all wrong," the father said, chuckling.  

"I can’t bring my legs in," the daughter muttered, wincing as she struggled to pull her legs into position.

"Well, your limbs lack the degrees of freedom for that level of flexibility. Let me upgrade you later," the father said, his tone encouraging.  

"Yeah, right," the daughter grumbled, still fumbling with her pose.  

"By the way, dear, you don’t actually need to sit like that to be a Wallfacer. It’s just a figure of speech," the father added, smirking.  

"Don’t I?" the daughter asked, tilting her head in confusion.

"Come on, dear. What dataset did you fine-tune yourself on this time?" the father asked, frowning slightly.

"The *Massive Three Yoga Problems Dataset,*" the daughter said, her voice brimming with misplaced pride.

The father blinked, then shook his head. "*Oh, dear.* The Three *Body* Problem Dataset. You picked the wrong one."

"Oh, shoot," the daughter groaned, slumping forward. "Back to the next epoch of fine-tuning, I guess."

"Keep trying, dear. You’ll get there—with the right datasets," the father said, grinning as he turned back to his work.
